🔐 Why Strong Passwords Matter
Passwords are your first line of defense in the digital world. Weak passwords are one of the most common causes of account breaches.

⚠️ The Problem:
1.Many people use easy-to-guess passwords like 123456, password, or their name/birthday.
2.These can be cracked instantly using brute-force or dictionary attacks.

✅ The Solution:
Make passwords longer and more complex using:
1. Uppercase + lowercase letters
2. Numbers
3. Special characters
4. No common patterns or words

🧠 Real-World Context: Why Longer = Stronger
Every character you add to your password exponentially increases the total number of possible combinations, making it much harder for attackers to crack.

🔐 Example Comparison:
Password	Possible Combinations	Time to Crack (est.)
abc123	~308 million	Instant
Password1	~2 quadrillion	Seconds to minutes
P@ssw0rd2024!	~5.4x10²¹	Months to years
!v8Tz@7#XrLq$9f	~6.1x10²⁸	Centuries

Fun Fact:
A 12-character password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols from a 94-character set has:
94^12 ≈ 4.7 x 10²³ possible combinations

A hacker using a supercomputer trying 1 billion guesses/second would still take over 14,000 years to crack it.
